// Given a matrix with an infinite number  of points in it
// write an algorithm that will find the highest point in 
// this matrix

// The only function you have to determine the height at 
// a particular x,y-coordinate is matrix.giveHeightCostly(x, y). 
// This function (as its name denotes) is very costly to 
// call, and you want to call it as little as possible. 

// Details about the matrix: 
// -- Infinite number of points
// -- Any path towards this highest point will be constantly
//    increasing
// -- Boundaries are from (0,0) to (100, 100). 
// -- Solution must be within the radius of the actual max
